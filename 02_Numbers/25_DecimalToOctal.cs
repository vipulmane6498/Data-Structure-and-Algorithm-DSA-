Decimal to Octal Conversion:
ðŸ“Œ What is an Octal Number?

An Octal Number is a number in base 8.
It only uses digits from 0 to 7.
Each place value is a power of 8 (just like in decimal each place value is a power of 10).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
Decimal 56 â†’ Octal?
Divide 56 by 8 â†’ quotient = 7, remainder = 0
Divide 7 by 8 â†’ quotient = 0, remainder = 7
Write remainders from bottom to top â†’ 70

â€‹
ðŸ“Œ Approach of the Code
1. Input the number from user (in decimal).
2. Store a copy of that number (to print later).
3. Use a loop to divide the number by 8 repeatedly until it becomes 0.
    3.1 Each time, find the remainder (num % 8).
    3.2 Add this remainder in front of the octal string.
    3.3 Update number as num = num / 8.
4. When the loop ends, the collected string will be the octal number.
5. Finally, print the result.

            // Example: if octal = "2" and remainder = 7, new octal = "72"
