Prime Number : A number only divisible by 1 and itself is called a prime number.
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...

We have 2 approaches to check if a number is prime or not:
1. Basic Approach: Check divisibility from 2 to n-1.
2. Efficient Approach:  Optimized Trial Division (up to square root)
