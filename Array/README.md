Patterns to solve Array Problems:

Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum
Binary Search (on sorted arrays or on the answer)
Hashing / Hash Map
Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm (for max subarray sum)
Greedy Technique
Sorting + Logic
Backtracking (Subsets, Combinations, Permutations)
Monotonic Stack / Queue
Matrix (2D Array) Patterns
Counting / Frequency Arrays
Bit Manipulation (XOR, masks, etc.)
Heap / Priority Queue (for top-K or ordering problems)
Union-Find / Disjoint Set (if connected components involved)
